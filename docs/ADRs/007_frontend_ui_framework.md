# Frontend UI Framework Selection

* Status: proposed
* Deciders: Platform Team, Frontend Team
* Date: 2025-12-05

## Context and Problem Statement

With the Nx polyglot monorepo strategy accepted (ADR-006), we must now select the UI framework and associated tooling for frontend applications. The first applications are a customer-facing e-commerce system and an employee POS system, with future plans for admin dashboards, merchandising tools, and order management interfaces.

This decision will establish the foundation for all frontend development, affecting developer experience, performance, hiring, and long-term maintainability.

## Guiding Principles

These principles inform the evaluation criteria and final decision, listed in priority order:

1. **LLM/AI Tooling Support** - Frameworks with strong representation in LLM training data enable better AI-assisted development (code generation, debugging, refactoring). Prioritize widely-used frameworks with extensive documentation and examples.
2. **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support with strict typing across components, state, and API boundaries
3. **Developer Productivity** - Minimize boilerplate, maximize iteration speed, enable hot module replacement
4. **Performance** - Fast initial load, efficient updates, optimized bundle sizes for e-commerce conversion
5. **Ecosystem Maturity** - Stable libraries, active maintenance, comprehensive documentation
6. **Team Scalability** - Easy onboarding, clear patterns, ability to hire experienced developers
7. **Nx Integration** - First-class support in Nx with generators, executors, and affected analysis
8. **Backend Alignment** - Complement reactive Spring Boot services with efficient data fetching patterns
9. **Progressive Enhancement** - Support for SSR/SSG where SEO matters (e-commerce), SPA where it doesn't (POS)
10. **Code Sharing** - Maximize reuse across e-commerce, POS, admin, and future mobile (React Native)
11. **Long-term Viability** - Framework with strong backing, community, and evolutionary path

**Note:** Current team experience (Angular) is valued but ranked below LLM support and ecosystem factors. The team can learn a new framework; AI tooling effectiveness is harder to change.

## Decision Drivers

1. **LLM training data prevalence** - Framework representation in AI models for code assistance
2. **E-commerce requirements** - SEO, performance, accessibility, conversion optimization
3. **POS requirements** - Offline capability, fast interactions, hardware integration (barcode, receipt)
4. **Nx ecosystem** - Quality of Nx plugins and generators for the framework
5. **State management** - Server state (API data) vs client state patterns
6. **Testing story** - Unit, integration, and E2E testing support
7. **Team experience** - Current team has Angular experience (valued but not decisive)

## Considered Options

### Framework Level

1. **React** - Component library with ecosystem flexibility
2. **Angular** - Full-featured opinionated framework

### React Ecosystem Options (if React chosen)

3. **React + Vite (Vanilla)** - Minimal setup, client-side SPA
4. **React + TanStack Query** - Server state management focus
5. **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework with SSR/SSG
6. **Remix** - Full-stack with nested routing and progressive enhancement
7. **React + Vite + TanStack Router** - Modern SPA with type-safe routing

## Decision Outcome

*(To be determined after evaluation)*

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### 1. React

Component library approach - "just the view layer" with ecosystem choice.

**Good**
- **Best LLM/AI support** - Largest training corpus, highest quality AI code generation and assistance
- Largest ecosystem and community
- Maximum flexibility in architecture choices
- Extensive Nx support (@nx/react, @nx/next)
- React Native path for mobile apps
- Hooks-based API is intuitive and composable
- Strong TypeScript support
- TanStack ecosystem (Query, Router, Table) is excellent
- Massive hiring pool

**Bad**
- Decision fatigue - must choose routing, state, styling, etc.
- No official "blessed" patterns - team must establish conventions
- Breaking changes between major versions (though improving)
- JSX is polarizing for some developers
- Team must learn React (current experience is Angular)

**Nx Support**
- `@nx/react` - Vite-based React apps and libs
- `@nx/next` - Next.js apps with full SSR support
- Generators for components, hooks, libs
- Module federation support for micro-frontends

### 2. Angular

Full-featured framework with batteries included.

**Good**
- **Team has existing Angular experience** - reduces initial learning curve
- Opinionated - routing, HTTP, forms, DI built-in
- Strong TypeScript integration (written in TS)
- Enterprise adoption and long-term Google backing
- Consistent patterns across projects
- RxJS aligns with reactive Spring Boot backend
- Excellent Nx support (Nx was originally Angular-focused)
- Signals API modernizing reactivity

**Bad**
- **Smaller LLM training corpus** - Less prevalent in AI training data than React, resulting in lower quality AI code assistance
- Steeper learning curve for new hires (modules, decorators, DI, RxJS)
- Larger bundle sizes historically (improving with Ivy/standalone)
- Smaller component ecosystem than React
- No direct path to mobile (Ionic or NativeScript, not as seamless as React Native)
- Hiring pool smaller than React
- More verbose than React for simple components

**Nx Support**
- `@nx/angular` - First-class support, generators, schematics
- Module federation for micro-frontends
- Strong affected analysis

### 3. React + Vite (Vanilla SPA)

Minimal React setup with Vite bundler, client-side only.

**Good**
- Fastest dev server startup and HMR
- Simplest mental model - just React
- Full control over architecture
- Smallest initial learning curve
- Easy to add libraries incrementally

**Bad**
- No SSR/SSG - poor for e-commerce SEO
- Must manually configure everything (routing, data fetching)
- No conventions - team must establish all patterns
- Risk of inconsistent patterns across apps

**Best For**: Internal tools, admin dashboards, POS

### 4. React + TanStack Query (+ Vite + TanStack Router)

Modern React SPA stack focused on server state management.

**Good**
- TanStack Query handles caching, deduplication, background refresh
- Eliminates most client-side state management needs
- Type-safe routing with TanStack Router
- Excellent DevTools for debugging
- Works with any backend (REST, GraphQL)

- Form-based mutations (web standards)
- No client-side state for most cases
- Excellent error boundaries
- Works well with edge deployment

**Bad**
- Smaller community than Next.js
- Shopify acquisition creates uncertainty
- Less Nx ecosystem support than Next.js
- Mental model shift from SPA patterns
- Fewer examples and tutorials

**Best For**: Form-heavy apps, progressive enhancement needs

### 7. React + Vite + TanStack Router

Modern SPA with type-safe file-based routing, without full-stack framework.

**Good**
- Full type safety from routes to loaders
- File-based routing similar to Next.js
- Search params as first-class state
- No framework lock-in

## Recommended Approach

*(To be filled after team discussion)*

Consider a **hybrid strategy** based on application needs:

| Application | Recommended Stack | Rationale |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------|
| E-commerce Web | Next.js (App Router) | SSR/SSG for SEO, image optimization |
| POS Web | React + TanStack Query + Vite | SPA, offline-first, fast interactions |
| Admin Dashboard | React + TanStack Query + Vite | Internal, no SEO needs |
| Merchandising | React + TanStack Query + Vite | Data-heavy, forms |
| Mobile Apps | React Native + TanStack Query | Code sharing with web |

**Shared across all:**
- TanStack Query for server state
- Shared UI component library (`libs/shared-ui`)
- Generated API types from OpenAPI
- Common validation schemas (Zod)

## Open Questions

- **Offline requirements** - How critical is offline-first for POS? (PWA vs native wrapper)
- **Server Components adoption** - If Next.js chosen, how aggressively to adopt React Server Components?

## Deferred to Separate ADR

The following decisions will be documented in ADR-008 after this framework decision is accepted:

- **Component library** - Build custom vs adopt (Radix, shadcn/ui, MUI, Chakra)
- **Styling approach** - Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules, styled-components, or CSS-in-JS
- **Design system** - Design tokens, theming architecture, accessibility standards
